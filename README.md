We wanted to design a website to help children aged 5-12 learn new languages. Especially today, knowing more than one language is an essential skill in any setting. We want to enable the next generation to gain such abilities while doing so in a playful manner to keep children engaged and willing to learn.

## Features

Our methodology focuses on learning new words through a series of **modules** (e.g. Colors, Pronouns, Family, and Phrases). Each module will contain six lessons, which are as follows:
1. **Picture Learning**
    * Learn the language by using an English word to select the corresponding image and foreign word.
2. **Matching Word to Word**
    * Matching game of foreign words to their corresponding English words.
3. **Matching Word to Image**
    * Matching game of foreign words to their corresponding images.
4. **Read the Sentence**
    * Work on your pronunciation by reading out the sentence and receiving feedback on it.
5. **Hide and Seek**
    * Learn about cultural objects through a game of Hide and Seek!
6. **Fill in the Blank**
    * Test your knowledge by filling in a foreign sentence with the correct word.

## Notes
* This repo contains a demo for the front-end, which currently only contains the Spanish colors module.
  * To play the Hide and Seek game locally, you will need to run the elephluent demo on an [HTTP server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server).
